<h2> Problem: </h2>
* In my problem solving repo I started posting problems solutions.<br>
* After a while, they became over 20 with All levels plus problems on other platforms. <br>
* I put the link of the problem always on the first line of the solution file.<br>
* I want to put each level of problems in a file indicating its difficulty level.<br>

<h2>Solution: </h2>
* The sript opens every file in the directory, and finds the link of the problem in the first line <br>
* It opens the link and tries to find the difficulty level by finding certain colors.
* It puts the problem in the created folder with the matching level. 


<h3>Limitations: </h3>
* It only works with leetcode, but maybe it can be generalized in the future.
